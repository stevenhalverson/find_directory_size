As far as I know from multiple internet searches, Windows 10/11 does not provide a way to display folder sizes in File Explorer. That is what this Python script does. A GUI is provided for convenience. 

Roadmap for improvements (in order of importance):
-Display folder sizes in GBs, rathe than just bytes. Possibly multiple options? (by byte, bit, MG, GB)
-Sort by folder size 
-Find largest folder within folder
